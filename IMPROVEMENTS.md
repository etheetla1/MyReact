## âœ… Completed Improvements

### 1. TypeScript Setup
- âœ… Added TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`)
- âœ… TypeScript and React types were already installed
- âœ… Configured strict mode and path mapping for better development experience

### 2. Environment Variables
- âœ… Created `.env` for development environment
- âœ… Created `.env.production` for production environment
- âœ… Updated S3 constants to use environment variables (`VITE_CDN_URL`)
- âœ… Added environment files to `.gitignore` for security

### 3. Dependency Cleanup
- âœ… Removed duplicate `motion` package (kept `framer-motion`)
- âœ… Cleaned up package.json dependencies

### 4. Error Boundaries
- âœ… Created comprehensive `ErrorBoundary` component with:
  - Professional error UI matching the site theme
  - Development vs production error handling
  - Refresh and navigation options
  - Detailed error information in development mode
- âœ… Wrapped all routes in `App.jsx` with ErrorBoundary
- âœ… Added to common components index for easy reuse

### 5. SEO Implementation
- âœ… Enhanced `index.html` with comprehensive meta tags:
  - Primary meta tags (title, description, keywords)
  - Open Graph tags for social media sharing
  - Twitter Card meta tags
  - Structured data (JSON-LD) for search engines
  - Theme colors and canonical URLs
- âœ… Created dynamic `SEOHead` component for page-specific SEO

  - About page with background and education info
- âœ… Added to common components for easy use across all pages

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Environment Variables Structure
```
VITE_APP_NAME=Knowelist Portfolio
VITE_CDN_URL=https://d2f1f8uiawofsx.cloudfront.net
VITE_SITE_URL=http://localhost:5173 (dev) / https://knowelist.com (prod)
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development/production
```

### Error Boundary Features
